        <h1 id="about" class="textshadowbox">Interests</h1>
        
        <p class="center">Well, my interests are a really variant part of myself. I am crazy about movies, I love read books and inspirational quotes and messages, and listen to music all the time. I am obsessed with all kinds of animals (dogs s2).  I am a really big comic story books fan. I love to get to know about the world, how to get the best out of people, how energy moves in our lives, how powerful is to live and think about posivive stuff. I thinks that all that you think, you attract. All that you believe you became and I always put my family first. By family I mean everyone that I love enough to say that they are part of my family. <br>

            <h2 id="colored" class="textshadowbox">Animals</h2>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I am really obsessed with animals of all kinds, sizes and colors since I was born basically. I go crazy of happiness when I see a squirrel, rabbit or dog in campus (and it does not neeed to be a puppy to make me happy :) )<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I was 8 years old, I decided that I was going to be a ocean biologist to save the dolphins and all animals in the ocean, after I saw a movie. Until now I - of course - did not make this dreams come true, but one day, after I have a good and stabled life, I will go for that dream (or being a vet would be awesome too!)<br>
            I have a dog and her name is Bella. Here is a picture of her :)</p>

        <h2 id="colored" class="textshadowbox">Movies</h2>
        
            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that movies, different than many things, has the power of change the perpective or point of view of people, in general. A simple fairy tale movie, a drama, or a love story, it can always change people's perspection oto something good. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two movies that express it in a great way. The first one it is called <i>"Take the Lead"</i> and it shows how you can change for good someone else's life, with something so simple as attention. The second movie it is called <i>"The Intouchables"</i>, and it shows how someone most likely to follow a bad path can change and change someone else's life and way of living, by being honest about everything that he has and live about. Both movies really worth to watch!
                <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as I wrote on my last assignment, my two top favorite movies are probably <i>Lying to be perfect</i> and <i>Mr. and Mrs. Smith</i>. Both very distinct movies, but I just adore them.</p>
            
            
            
            <h2 id="colored" class="textshadowbox">Readings</h2>
            
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I love to read romantic books, fantasy books, and books that wil end up changing my mind or my mood in every new read page (like <i>The Power of Now</i>). <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now I am reading a book that I gained as a Christmas present from my best friend-roomate from last semester. The name of the book is <i>Me Before You</i>, but I cannot focus on that reading yet, because of all work that I need to do :p  </p>
            
            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I love to be inspired by Buddha quotes, or from motivational speakers. My two main motivational people are my mom and my sis, and they put me up every day doing and talking about simple things, but showing me always that everything has a reason and that we need to be the best versions of ourselves.</p>
            
            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This weekend I watched  a video that really brought me back to what I have always been, a "D.U.M.B. goals" kind of person:</p>
            <div class="center">
                <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/54aFTZ9POw4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
            
            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a quote from one of my favorite movies that says:</p>
            <p class="center">"Sometimes you just need to take charge of your own life and be all that you can be" - from Lying to be Perfect</p>
            
            <p> Some others that inspire me always: <br> "If you think you can, you can"
                <br>
                "Courage doens't always roar.Sometimes courage is the wuiet voice at the end of the day saying, 'I will try again tomorrow' - Mary Anne Radmacher"
                <br>
                "Sometimes you're not given what you want because something better is planned for you instead"
                <br>
                "What you think you become. What you feel you attract, What you imagine you create. - Buddha"
                <br>
                "Think happy thoughts and put a smile in your face so that positive opportunities can find you."
        
            </p>
            
                        
            <h2 id="colored" class="textshadowbox">Music</h2>
            
            <p>I love music and I cannot stay in a completely silent place. Even if I want to relax, sometimes my mood call for heavy rock or even yoga based type of songs. Always depending on my mood.</p>
            <p>I am a big fan of classic songs, but I am completely ecletic, liking from Frank Sinatra and Elvis Presley, to Little Mix, One Direction, Rixton, AC/DC and Nickelback (my favorite band).</p>
            
            Some of my favorite songs are <i>Animals - from Nickelback</i>, <i>Why don't you and I - From Santana & Alex Band</i> and <i>Haven't met you yet - from Michel Bublé</i>.
            
        <h2 id="colored" class="textshadowbox">Sports</h2>
            
            <p>I also love sports! I was overweight and over my "supposed to be" height my whole life basically, but I have never been a sedentary person. I always played in my school with my classmates during the breaks, I had a bike that I remember to ride all weekends, and I also grew up with my cousin being my little brother (until my sister was born :p), so I always played soccer with him and any other sport that we wanted. My mom is like 5 feet but she always loved volleyball and she passed this passion to me, so we always played it too. </p>
            
            <p>When I started to grow up, I kept playing sports in my classes in middle and high school and I started to go to the gym when I was 16. The only time that I have even been on my "right" weight was when I was 16 actually. </p>
            
            <p>I also love to dance, a lot. I has ballet classes when I was 5 and during the time that I spent in the day care when I was little, but after that never again. But I was always a good dancer and nowadays I go to zumba classes and hip hop step classes, but I really like all kinds dance.</p>
            
            <p>I started to boxing when I was 17 and I practice that for a few years, in and out of classes and I almost started to compete, but I injured my left hand and I needed to stop boxing for a while now.</p>
            
            <p>Since Spring break of this year, I am running, so this is making me feel awesome too. I am not running as often as I wanted because of the ït's cold, it's warm again" weather, but now warming up again I will come back slowly to running again. </p>
